The Redmond Inspired WordPress Theme is a personal homage to what I consider to be one of the most important and influential operating systems of the Internet Age: Windows XP.

Windows XP is still in use by businesses around the world. When it was introduced, it was unparallelled in performance and support. Learning from lessons from Windows ME and Windows 2000, this operating system became the core of Microsoft's producting offering during the first decade of the 21st century.

While newer versions of Windows were released several years later, Windows XP endured due to its simple but comfortable UI / UX experience, its stability, and it's compatibility with hardware both new and old. Its eventual deprecation came at the hands of 64bit Operating Systems, which were better equipped to handle the hardware which became available on the market. But Windows XP still has a fond place in the hearts of its users.

This homage is not a perfect replica of Windows XP, as a blog is not an operating system. However many of the functions which made this influential operating system so important have been retained.
